# Human History Timeline

### World Peace
Humanity achieves the means to stop eons of constant warfare. The world population is freed to move unhindered across the planet's surface. Forbidden technologies are rediscovered and utilized for the good of humankind. However, after a series of public accidents, restrictions on experimentation and usage of Nth Dimension Technology are agreed upon by all world leaders. When humanity discovers proof of other intelligent life, first contact seems imminent. This proof was a message of peace coming from the far side of the Moon...

### Invasion
Peace is shattered as unexpectedly an alien invasion commences and all major human cities are attacked. Human artifacts and monuments are destroyed worldwide. Mysterious mass evacuations begin to occur in most human cities. The surface of the Earth quickly becomes unsafe as monstrous war machines overwhelm the remaining human military forces. Those who could afford it move deep underground in an attempt to avoid the war. Those who could not were conscripted into the Resistance effort.

Unable to confront the invaders directly, the military executes it's most desperate plan yet; an assault on the far side of the Moon and the source of the alien peace message...

### Cataclysm
A sizable human SAS assault fleet is launched into orbit to eliminate the source of the enemy threat and re-occupy the Moon. As the fleet approaches, the lunar surface suddenly sheers off into a massive debris field that falls towards the Earth, destroying the assault fleet, and plummeting into the Earth's atmosphere.

A small fire-team survives the debris field and successfully navigates to the enemy moon base. Upon arrival, they immediately discover the base to be long-abandoned, save for a single large switch...

## Locations
The Moon Spire
Facing away from the Earth, the far side of the moon is the perfect home base for the alien invasion force. The alien underground lunar base is hidden from aerial view. Only the surface entrance is visible.

### The Dead Zones
The Dead Zones are areas of very low atmospheric light due to a ongoing destruction of the environment. Common to the the Dead Zones are the ancient automated war-machines (Wors), left over from the planetâ€™s war-torn civilization. These machines are huge, spiritual/organic/technological masses that resemble monstrous death-machines, with animal-like bodies and simple minds. These death-machines live by instinct, caught in a cycle/loop which keeps them on their continual destructive path. The true source of the Dead Zones are the Fire Cities.

### Fire Cities
The fire cities are not human cities, as organic/natural life typically cannot exist in these areas. Only machine life survives in the fire cities. The source of the fire cities is the run-away technology created by DimTec experimentation. These machines cannot be controlled by humans, do not typically think for themselves, and exist only to serve the cause of the fire cities. The sky is black from thick pollution. There is very little visibility lit by distant flames of the fire city generators. Oil is the key component that the fire cities depend on. Large machines are routinely sent out beyond the Dead Zones to harvest more natural resources.

### The Underground
Humanity escaped to the underground after the cataclysm. They use the surface mostly for mining, and for growing certain resources unobtainable deep within the earth. However, the population still has diminished greatly, as nearly all underground bases had eventually tapped out of vital resources. Most bases had eternal power sources, and had automated security systems, however as food ran out and the people forgot, they left and as time went on, could not remember how to re-enter.

## Technology
Dimensional Technology
(DimTec) employs use of 'Nth Dimension Technology' to refashion material in the known 3 dimensions, convert between matter and energy, and transform basic elements (alchemy).

### Schema
A dimensional reference point that blueprints and reflects all living beings. After death, a life's schema will come apart into individual essences. Each schema must be identified and reorganized if artificial reincarnation is to occur.

### Incarnation
This technology harnesses the spiritual energy of 'reincarnation' to give birth to a conscious cybernetic organism. If performed correctly, the new life form retains the memories and functionality of it's previous 'life'.

### Rebirth
The mechanism which allows machines to live forever. As a machine nears the end of it's life cycle or becomes damaged, it's body mass will collapse and a mechachrysalis will form within it. Deep within the artificial cocoon, all of it's energy-matter is broken down and blueprinted based on it's schema into a new generation of the same kind. Finally the newly formed life is reborn by breaking free of the hard outer shell. During the developmental stage, some types of mechachrysalis are vulnerable to attack while others may have substantial self-defence capabilities and are never vulnerable.

### Soul Memory
The memories created by living beings are mostly destroyed when they die. However, some memories common to all experiences are retained in reincarnation. These types of Soul Memories operate at the basic instinct level and do not have to be re-learned. These might include the fears related to predators, isolation, social exclusion, personal security, etc. Utilizing Schema Technology it becomes possible to retain a more complete memory record by storing specific references to memory events within the schema of Soul Memory during Incarnation.

The Fire Cities are an unfortunate side-effect of Soul Memory. It is believed the Fire Cities came into existence as a result of unresolved negative human soul energy after the Cataclysm. The Fire Cities themselves resemble the slave-master social structure inherent in most preceding human societies, operating on economical programming embedded deep within the Soul Memory of the deceased human population. One of many flaws inherent in all Fire Machines Soul Memory is the need to perform at optimal productivity. However, since the machines immediately consume everything they produce, their productivity rate is stuck at 0%.

## Vehicles
RAV
Roving Assault Vehicles are evasive, ground-based lunar rovers built to take advantage of the Moon's low gravity. These assault vehicles carry one passenger and are built to withstand most impacts. Making use of low-powered retro rockets, RAVs can adjust their position in the air to maintain horizon, fire at targets, and still land softly on the moon's surface. However, the real power of the RAVs are their ground speed. As retro rockets fire upward keeping the RAV bound to the terrain, pairs of caterpillar tracks align across it's the bottom, spinning at super sonic speeds, lurching the vehicle forward at impressive speeds.
