            <h1>Technology</h1>

            <h2 id="dimtec">Dimensional Technology</h2>
            <p>
                <em>(DimTec)</em> employs use of <em>'Nth Dimension Technology'</em> to refashion material in the known 3 dimensions,
                convert between matter and energy, and transform basic elements (alchemy).
            </p>

            <h3 id="schema">Schema</h3>
            <p>
                A dimensional reference point that blueprints and reflects all living beings.
                After death, a life's schema will come apart into individual essences.
                Each schema must be identified and reorganized if <em>artificial reincarnation</em> is to occur.
            </p>

            <h3 id="incarnation">Incarnation</h3>
            <p>
                This technology harnesses the spiritual energy of 'reincarnation' to give birth to a conscious cybernetic organism.
                If performed correctly, the new life form retains the memories and functionality of it's previous 'life'.
            </p>

            <h3 id="rebirth">Rebirth</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanism which allows machines to <em>live forever</em>.
                As a machine nears the end of it's life cycle or becomes damaged, it's body mass will collapse and a <em>mechachrysalis</em> will form within it.
                Deep within the artificial cocoon, all of it's energy-matter is broken down and blueprinted based on it's <em>schema</em> into a new generation of the same kind.
                Finally the newly formed life is reborn by breaking free of the hard outer shell.
                During the developmental stage, some types of mechachrysalis are vulnerable to attack while others may have substantial self-defence capabilities and are never vulnerable.
            </p>

            <h2 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h2>

            <h3 id="rav">RAV</h3>
            <p>
                <em>R</em>oving <em>A</em>ssault <em>V</em>ehicles are evasive, ground-based lunar rovers built to take advantage of the Moon's low gravity.
                These assault vehicles carry one passenger and are built to withstand most impacts.
                Making use of low-powered retro rockets, RAVs can adjust their position in the air to maintain horizon, fire at targets, and still land softly on the moon's surface.
                However, the real power of the RAVs are their ground speed.
                As retro rockets fire upward keeping the RAV bound to the terrain, pairs of high-tread wheels align across it's the bottom, spinning at super sonic speeds, lurching the vehicle forward at impressive speeds.
