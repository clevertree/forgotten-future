            <h1>Locations</h1>

            <h2 id="moon">The Moon</h2>
            <p>
                Facing away from the Earth, the far side of the moon is the perfect home base for the alien invasion force.
            </p>

                <h3 id="moon-spire">The Moon Spire</h3>
                <p>
                    The alien underground lunar base is hidden from aerial view. Only the surface entrance is visible.
                </p>


            <h2 id="earth">The Earth</h2>

                <h3 id="dead-zone">The Dead Zones</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dead Zones are areas of very low atmospheric light due to a ongoing destruction of the environment.
                    Common to the the Dead Zones are the ancient automated war-machines (Wors), left over from the planetâ€™s war-torn civilization.
                    These machines are huge, spiritual/organic/technological masses that resemble monstrous death-machines, with animal-like bodies and simple minds.
                    These death-machines live by instinct, caught in a cycle/loop which keeps them on their continual destructive path.
                    The true source of the Dead Zones are the <a href="site/locations.html#fire-cities">Fire Cities</a>.
                </p>

                <h3 id="fire-cities">Fire Cities</h3>
                <p>
                    The fire cities are not human cities, as organic/natural life typically cannot exist in these areas.
                    Only machine life survives in the fire cities.
                    The source of the fire cities is the run-away technology created by DimTec experimentation.
                    These machines cannot be controlled by humans, do not typically think for themselves, and exist only to serve the cause of the fire cities.
                    The sky is black from thick pollution. There is very little visibility lit by distant flames of the fire city generators.
                    Oil is the key component that the fire cities depend on. Large machines are routinely sent out beyond the Dead Zones to harvest more natural resources.
                </p>

                <h3 id="underground">The Underground</h3>
                <p>
                    Humanity escaped to the <em>underground</em> after the cataclysm.
                    They use the surface mostly for mining, and for growing certain resources unobtainable deep within the earth.
                    However, the population still has diminished greatly, as nearly all underground bases had eventually tapped out of vital resources.
                    Most bases had eternal power sources, and had automated security systems, however as food ran out and the people forgot, they left and as time went on, could not remember how to re-enter.
